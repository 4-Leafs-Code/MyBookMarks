# MyBookMarks
Just a Markdown file of some cool repos I like so I can clean up my github


### React/ Javascript
* [Firebase Web Snippets](https://github.com/firebase/snippets-web)- This repository holds code snippets used in Web documentation on firebase.google.com. These snippets are part of our documentation and best read in the context of a documentation page rather than used directly. If you're looking to get started with the Firebase Web SDK the best place to start is quickstart-js.
* [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)- A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security. Feel free to improve with your payloads and techniques!

Styles and features
---
* [parallax.js](https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax)- Parallax Engine that reacts to the orientation of a smart device. Where no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available, the position of the cursor is used instead.
* [Hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover)- A collection of CSS3 powered hover effects to be applied to links, buttons, logos, SVG, featured images and so on. Easily apply to your own elements, modify or just use for inspiration. Available in CSS, Sass, and LESS.
* [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)- React-Bootstrap is compatible with various versions of Bootstrap. As such, you need to ensure you are using the correct combination of versions.
* [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion)- For 95% of use-cases of animating components, we don't have to resort to using hard-coded easing curves and duration. Set up a stiffness and damping for your UI element, and let the magic of physics take care of the rest. This way, you don't have to worry about petty situations such as interrupted animation behavior. It also greatly simplifies the API.
